//uniform
varying vec2 v_textcoord;

    //we cast the vec3 attribute position into a vec4
    //why .w is 1 is a topic on its own, but it represents
    //a position in space, versus a direction
    vec4 _position=vec4(position,1.);
    //next we need to tell this vertex to be somewhere in 3d space
    //this is the contract we accept when working with a scene graph
    //the modelMatrix represents the position of our Mesh and all
    //the parents above it:
    vec4 worldPosition=modelMatrix*_position;
    //next we get information from the render(scene,CAMERA)
    //the camera used for that call gives us the viewMatrix uniform
    //this transforms the world (through this vertex) into something
    //called "camera space" or "view space"
    vec4 viewPosition=viewMatrix*worldPosition;
    //this space is suitable for further transformations so we
    //apply the projectionMatrix
    vec4 perspectiveSpace=projectionMatrix*viewPosition;
